# GenForce Lib for Generative Modeling

An efficient PyTorch library for deep generative modeling. May the Generative Force (GenForce) be with You.

## Highlights

- **Distributed** training framework.
- **Fast** training speed.
- **Modular** design for prototyping new models.
- **Highly** reproducing the training of StyleGAN compared to [the official TensorFlow version](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan).
- **Model zoo** containing a rich set of pretrained GAN models, with [Colab live demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/genforce/genforce/blob/master/docs/synthesize_demo.ipynb) to play.

We will also support following functions *in the very near future*. Please **STAY TUNED**.

- Training of PGGAN and StyleGAN2 (and likely BigGAN too).
- Benchmark on model training.
- Training of GAN encoder from [In-Domain GAN Inversion](https://genforce.github.io/idinvert).
- Other recent work from our [GenForce](http://genforce.github.io/).

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment via `conda`.

   ```shell
   conda create -n genforce python=3.7
   conda activate genforce
   ```

2. Install `torch` and `torchvision`.

   ```shell
   conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.1 torchvision -c pytorch
   ```

3. Install requirements.

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Demo

We provide a quick training demo, `scripts/stylegan_training_demo.py`, which allows to train StyleGAN on a toy dataset (500 animeface images with 64 x 64 resolution). Try it via

```shell
./scripts/stylegan_training_demo.sh
```

We also provide an inference demo, `synthesize.py`, which allows to synthesize images with pre-trained models. Generated images can be found at `work_dirs/synthesis_results/`. Try it via

```shell
python synthesize.py stylegan_ffhq1024
```

You can also play the demo at [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/genforce/genforce/blob/master/docs/synthesize_demo.ipynb).

## Get Started

### Test

Pre-trained models can be found at [model zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md).

- On local machine:

  ```shell
  GPUS=8
  CONFIG=configs/stylegan_ffhq256_val.py
  WORK_DIR=work_dirs/stylegan_ffhq256_val
  CHECKPOINT=checkpoints/stylegan_ffhq256.pth
  ./scripts/dist_test.sh ${GPUS} ${CONFIG} ${WORK_DIR} ${CHECKPOINT}
  ```

- Using `slurm`:

  ```shell
  CONFIG=configs/stylegan_ffhq256_val.py
  WORK_DIR=work_dirs/stylegan_ffhq256_val
  CHECKPOINT=checkpoints/stylegan_ffhq256.pth
  GPUS=8 ./scripts/slurm_test.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} \
      ${CONFIG} ${WORK_DIR} ${CHECKPOINT}
  ```

### Train

All log files in the training process, such as log message, checkpoints, synthesis snapshots, etc, will be saved to the work directory.

- On local machine:

  ```shell
  GPUS=8
  CONFIG=configs/stylegan_ffhq256.py
  WORK_DIR=work_dirs/stylegan_ffhq256_train
  ./scripts/dist_train.sh ${GPUS} ${CONFIG} ${WORK_DIR} \
      [--options additional_arguments]
  ```

- Using `slurm`:

  ```shell
  CONFIG=configs/stylegan_ffhq256.py
  WORK_DIR=work_dirs/stylegan_ffhq256_train
  GPUS=8 ./scripts/slurm_train.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} \
      ${CONFIG} ${WORK_DIR} \
      [--options additional_arguments]
  ```
